                We like to keep it simple :)
                <br>
                <br>There are three kids working Remotely in India
                <br>
                <br>Making this happen - One is Designer, One is Coder Boy & One who keeps jumping in and helps both of us
                <br>
                <br>Designer / Pravin
                <br>Coder / Vivek
                <br>Manager / Sushant
                <br>
                <br>We all came together to make this simple side-project happen
                <br>
                <br>Plan was simple -- Creating something once that can be used again and again
                <br>
                <br>In our clients project process we use to make forms and setups server each and every-time
                <br>
                <br>We looked of simple & minimal solution in community and market, Didn't found one
                <br>
                <br>So we decided to go ahead and make one, ye that's how we do it :)
                <br>
                <br>We are trying to keep this alive at as low cost as possible by using cheap solution
                <br>
                <br>If got good response we might invest for community, Let's see
